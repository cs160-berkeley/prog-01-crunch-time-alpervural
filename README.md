# PROG 01: Crunch Time

My application focuses on simplicity. The user can select one of the 
four exercises using a drop down list, enter an amount into the text 
field, and press the show stats button to see how many calories they 
burned and equivalent amounts from other exercises. The reps/minutes 
option is built into the exercise selection so the user does not 
need to worry about that.
